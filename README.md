# OpenMMO
Extensible MMO server logic and client api. (Far from usable in it's current state)

## Vision
This project aims to become a base for MMO developers to start from regardless of the type of game they are making. The game could be VR, 3D, 2D, CLI; It does not matter. This project will offer a front end (starting with .NET) to communicate with the game server, and a game search that is very flexible.
